# Items you'll be glad you packed!

A few years of attending the festival has left me with a list of items that I wouldn't normally think to pack.

Here's my list in case you want to be the envy of your friends :)

- [ ] Phone numbers of your friends and a local taxi company written on a post-it note or your arm (in case your phone dies and you need to get in touch with them)
- [ ] A couple cheap rain ponchos (it's looking pretty dreary this year)
- [ ] Earplugs (in case you get stuck right next to a set of speakers)
- [ ] Sandwiches and snacks (save some $! Sandwiches and snacks are allowed in non-marketable quantities)
- [ ] Your phone's memory cleared to take tons of photos and videos (it's no fun to have to decide which memories to delete on the fly)
- [x] Something to put on the ground to sit on (tarp, towel, etc.)
